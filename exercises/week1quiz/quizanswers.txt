- What are the personal configuration files for your shell?
    Shell configuration files are executed automatically when you log in and out of a shell.
    BASH defines three configurations files: .bash_profile, .bashrc, and .bash_logout. 
    .bash_profile contains initialization commands that set environment variables, a shell's prompt and so on. 
    The .bashrc contains commands that configure the shell, define command aliases and set command shell options. 
    .bash_profile is executed automatically when a user logs into a shell, along with .bashrc. 
    The .bash_logout file is executed when the user logs out of a shell. 
    .bash_logout contains cleanup operations and other commands that you want the shell to execute whenever a user logs out of a shell.

    "echo" displays a line of text.
    "time" run programs and summarize system resource usage. Example "time make" to see how long it take to makefile.
    "date" print or sets the system date and time.

    shell commands (?)

- At your system, does your shell-completion work for the long options and/or Makefile targets?
